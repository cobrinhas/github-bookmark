# github-bookmark ðŸ“–

A micro browser extension that saves a web page URL as a GitHub issue

## Why?

Everyday I share an article I've read in my [blog](https://joaomagfreitas.link/reads). Usually I bookmark articles to read in the next few days, but I rarely access my bookmark folder to revisit them ðŸ¤· My solution for this problem is to post the articles I certainly know I want to read, as an issue in my blog GitHub repository. This extension helps me automate the process of creating the issue, by mimicking the process of bookmarking a page in the browser.

## How does it looks like?
